Mivascript-Textmate-Bundle
==========================

Copy of the Mivascript Textmate bundle from "luis" [[who announced it way back in 2009][http://extranet.mivamerchant.com/forums/showthread.php?12460-mac-amp-compiler&p=98953#post98953]]
 which was hosted at http://sifent.com/blog/2009/03/03/textmate-miva-script-bundle/ but that no longer exists. I'm putting it here for folks looking for it.

 Not sure how much of it works. I manily use it for syntax highlight whenever I have to go back and work on our miva module for Runa.com
